Sometimes you've gotta leave what you love
To make that love grow strong
There comes a time when a voice inside will tell you where you truly belong.
You search your heart and you will find
The answer has been there all the time

CHORUS
Tonight all my dreams unfold
The hand of love has touched my soul
The longest journey's reached the end of the road
I will never walk alone as my dreams unfold

Goodbyeâs the hardest word to say
Each and every time
And if I had to leave this sacred place
I would leave my soul behind
You search your heart and you will find
The answer has been there all the time

CHORUS
Tonight - all my dreams unfold
The hand of love has touched my soul
The longest journey's reached the end of the road
I will never walk alone as my dreams unfold

Close your eyes and you'll hear my call
Through every high and through every low
Let's prove - we can weather the storm

CHORUS
Tonight all my dreams unfold
The hand of love has touched my soul
And I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life and I'll never let it go
The longest journey's reached the end of the road
I will never walk alone as my dreams unfold
